Upgrade cluster from version 1.18 to 1.19

Show list of cluster nodes

`kubectl get nodes`{{execute HOST1}}

Here we have cluster with 1.18 version

List all of objects in default namespace

`kubectl get all -o wide`{{execute HOST1}}

Out goal is to have running 1.19 version cluster.

`kubectl version --short 
kubeadm version -o short
kubelet --version
`{{execute}}

Update packages

`apt-get update`{{execute HOST1}}

Install specific version of  kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl

`apt-get install kubeadm=1.24.0-00 kubectl=1.24.0-00 kubelet=1.24.0-00 -y`{{execute HOST1}}

What upgrade plan is possible ?

`kubeadm upgrade plan`{{execute HOST1}}

Let's upgrade (remember to confirm by pressing y key) 

`kubeadm upgrade apply v1.24.0`{{execute HOST1}}

Let's see the cluster nodes

`kubectl get nodes`{{execute HOST1}}

Now we have master node with 1.24 version and worker node with 1.23

**Look what deployment and pods are on our cluster. Preserve them**


The first thing is to detach worker node from kubernetes cluster.

`kubectl drain node01`{{execute HOST1}}

<pre>
node/node01 cordoned
error: unable to drain node "node01", aborting command...

There are pending nodes to be drained:
 node01
cannot delete Pods not managed by ReplicationController, ReplicaSet, Job, DaemonSet or StatefulSet (use --force to override): alone/alone-pod, alone/web-server
cannot delete DaemonSet-managed Pods (use --ignore-daemonsets to ignore): kube-system/calico-node-pdjlj, kube-system/kube-proxy-kqlkj
</pre>

List all pods running on node01

`kubectl describe node node01 |grep Non-terminated -A 8`{{execute}}

`kubectl get pod -n alone`{{execute}}

`ssh node01`{{execute HOST1}}

On node01 node

`apt-get update`{{execute}}

`apt-get install kubelet=1.14.0-00 -y `{{execute}}

Now we should restart kubelet
`systemctl restart kubelet`{{execute}}



On master node

`kubectl uncordon node01`{{execute}}

`kubectl get nodes`{{execute}}

`kubectl get pod -o wide`{{execute}}} 

What we have in alone namespace

`kubectl get all -n alone`{{execute}}} 

CHECK

`kubectl get nodes | grep 1.24.0 | grep Ready | wc -l | grep 2 && echo "done"`{{execute}}

`kubectl get pod alone-pod web-server -n alone | grep Running |wc -l | grep 2 && echo "done"`{{execute}}

CHECK

To continue you should have 1.24 Kubernetes cluster with two nodes (ready)

**To move to the next step make sure to have all checks with "done"**
