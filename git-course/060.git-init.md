Git Revert
To revert multiple commits at once we use the character ~ to mean minus. For example, HEAD~2 is two commits from the head. This can be combined with the characters ... to say between two commits.

Task
Use the command git revert HEAD...HEAD~2 to revert the commits between HEAD and HEAD~2.

Protip
You can use the command git log --oneline for a quick overview of the commit history.
